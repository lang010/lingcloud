## About LingCloud ##

LingCloud is a suite of cloud computing system software developed by the Research Group of Distributed and Cloud Computing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. LingCloud provides a resource single leasing point system for consolidated leasing physical and virtual machines, and supports various heterogeneous application modes including high performance computing, large scale data processing, massive data storage, etc. on shared infrastructure. LingCloud can help to build private clouds for governments, enterprises, schools and research institutes, and it is also suitable to construct public clouds for managing data centers.

LingCloud has been adopted in some affiliations of China. In order to promote the development of cloud computing industry in China and strengthen the communication between academia and industry, the LingCloud development team decides to make LingCloud open-source. The main part of LingCloud is licensed under Apache License 2.0. We welcome any organizations or individuals dedicated to cloud computing to get involved in the development of LingCloud sincerely. Let's contribute to the development of China's cloud computing industry together.

## What Can LingCloud Do? ##
