================================================================================
1. Commercial use
================================================================================

According to Apache License 2.0, the main part of LingCloud open-source release 
is free for commercial use without technical support services. However, to use 
LingCloud commercially, you must also follow the licenses of the 3rd-party 
components, so you probably need to buy the commercial licenses from the 
3rd-party or find alternative solutions. The components involving commercial 
licenses include but not limited to:
  * MySQL Connector/J
  * TightVNC Java Viewer

================================================================================
2. GPL licensed 3rd-party components
================================================================================

There are a few GPL licensed 3rd-party components in LingCloud open-source 
release, which is reasonable and legal usage for the following reasons in our 
opinion.

(a) MySQL Connector/J. A FOSS License Exception is declared by Oracle to allow 
the open-source integration without the limit of GPL.
( http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/ )

(b) RRDtool. A FLOSS License Exception is declared by Tobias Oetiker, the author
of RRDtool, to allow the open-source integration without the limit of GPL.
( http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/license.en.html )

(c) TightVNC Java Viewer. We have got a pre-authorization for open-source 
integration by email from GlavSoft LLC. We are waiting for the formal license 
agreement.

(d) properJavaRDP. We have got a permit by email from Tom Elliott, one of the 
project administrators of properJavaRDP. This permit allows LingCloud using the
binary package of properJavaRDP without specific requirements.

We are grateful to all the open-source authors and volunteers of the 3rd-party 
components.
